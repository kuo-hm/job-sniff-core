## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed  
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start RabbitMQ, Postgres, and all core services  
3. Follow each serviceâ€™s README inside their folder for service-specific setup and running instructions

## Development

- Each service lives in its own folder with its own README and dependencies  
- Shared libraries should be used to keep auth and config consistent across services  
- Use the API Gateway as the single entry point for all client requests
